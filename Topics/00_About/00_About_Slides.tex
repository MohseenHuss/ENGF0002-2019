\frametitle{Welcome to UCL Engineering \& Computer Science!}

Our aim is to prepare you to be the \emc{best engineers in the world}!

\vspace{10mm}
Engineering is the discipline of \emc{shaping the world} around us 

for the \emc{benefit of humanity}.

\frametitle{Overall aims of the ENGF0002.} 

The essence of good engineering is \emc{quality}. This course aims to:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Teach you professional skills important in all engineering.
	\item Teach you computer science specific professional skills.
	\item Expose you to important social and ethical discussions.
	\item Provide opportunities to practice all those skills.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{3mm} Most of the teaching is by Computer Science faculty, but this is
an Engineering module, so some of the non-CS parts will be assessed by
Engineering staff.

\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
\item Technical writing.
\item Engineering visualization.
\item Technical Presentations.
\item Effective team work \& dynamics.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What Computer Science Skills?} 

Computer Science lies at the intersection of \emc{mathematics} and \emc{engineering}. It solves problems through the manipulation of \emc{information}, and \emc{computation}.

\vspace{3mm}
This module will cover:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The \emc{principles of programming} illustrated in Python.
	\item Techniques for developing and reasoning about \emc{software correctness}.
        \item Techniques for \emc{debugging software}.
	\item The principles of \emc{data structures} and \emc{algorithms}, their implementation and performance.
	\item The organization of \emc{software production} in teams.
	\item Key tools and technologies for \emc{rapid prototyping}.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Lectures} 

Familiarize your self with the timetable: \url{https://timetable.ucl.ac.uk}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Tuesday 09:00--11:00 -- Lectures.\\
\item Friday 11:00--13:00 -- Lectures.\\
All lectures are in Bentham House Denys Holland Lecture Theatre.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{CS Practical Work}

  Aim is to have practical work every week - most of it programming.

\vspace{3mm}
  Most of the practical exercises are \emc{not assessed}.  You must hand in
  a reasonable attempt at solution though - will receive a \emc{binary
  mark}.

 \begin{description}
  \item[{\bf For unassessed exercises,}] you may work with your friends, or in
  small groups.  You can learn a lot by discussing ideas together.

  \vspace{3mm}
Generally, working in pairs works best.  In larger groups you learn
  less.

  \item[{\bf For assessed exercises,}] your work \emc{\bf must be your own}.  We will make
  it clear which these are, and will run plagiarism detection software
  on the submissions.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Practical Exercises}

  Goal is to learn by doing

  \vspace{2mm}
  And by having some fun

  \vspace{2mm}
  Will give you software for some simple retro games.\\
  Your tasks:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Play game, find bugs.
  \item Understand bugs by reading and instrumenting code.
  \item Fix the bugs.
  \end{enumerate}
  Option: improve the games.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why Debugging?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item You can't write bug free code.
  \item You can't write non-trivial code unless you can debug it.
  \item You can only learn debugging by doing it.
  \item Debugging trivial code doesn't teach you much.
  \end{itemize}

  Forces you to confront code that you don't understand, and
  progressively learn about it.
  \vspace{2mm}
  \begin{description}
  \item Teaches you programming by example.
  \item Teaches you about code structure.
  \end{description}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Assessment}

  Course has no exam.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Binary marks from practical exercises and classroom tests 5\%.
    \item Mid-term coursework (week 5): 15\%
    \item Technical writing coursework (week 8): 15\%
    \item Ethics report (400-500 words, due end of Feb 2018): 15\%
    \item Ethics report presentations (during term 2 reading week): 10\%
    \item CS Scenario week (term 2): 40\%
  \end{itemize}

We will provide more information during term.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Pebble in the Pond activity} 

Friday 5th October, 11am-1pm. Jeffery Hall.

\begin{itemize}
	\item You are working in groups of 5-6, randomly assigned on arrival.
	\item Each group is in charge of a segment of table.
	\item You are provided materials, and need to design a machine.
	\item That takes a pebble (rock) from one end of the set of tables to the other. The pebble must only touch the machine.
	\item Aims: fun, opportunity to meet \& reflections on team work.
\end{itemize}


Arrive promptly at 11am, find your group, and pick a CS table at random quickly! Then listen to the instructions carefully.
